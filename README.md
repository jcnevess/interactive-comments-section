## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, Read, Update, and Delete comments and replies
- Upvote and downvote comments
- **Bonus**: If you're building a purely front-end project, use `localStorage` to save the current state in the browser that persists when the browser is refreshed.
- **Bonus**: Instead of using the `createdAt` strings from the `data.json` file, try using timestamps and dynamically track the time since the comment or reply was posted.

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

### What I learned

In this project I had the chance to learn how to use `localStorage` and exercise my understanding of 
Next.js `server` and `client` components.

At first, I used an prop drilling approach. I was difficult to follow and I became so overwhelmed
that I almost gave up on the challenge. But with some resilience I could get it done.

Next, I searched for better solutions and stumbled with two alternatives: `Redux` or React built-in `useReducer`.
Redux is a battle-tested state management tool, but I choose to learn built-in features first. 

I had some difficulties to make useReducer to work along `localStorage`, but after some search
and persistence I could get it done.

This was my first time using the `useContext` hook aswell. It was very useful for state management and to keep 
track of current user data.

Things that could be better: Every comment is ordered by score, even replies.
